# OOBPgradedExcercise
The first graded exercise, the dungeon!
All you need to do is open the dungeon.js file and of course  move it to vsc to play. There is one extra room and three extra monsters! Have fun playing... ^-^
ALSO there is some things in the code that I didn't use in the end and some issues in the moving logic...

Second assignment was to do a online shop.
